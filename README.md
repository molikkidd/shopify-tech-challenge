## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## The Shopify Challenge

You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
A form for entering text prompts
Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.

## Extras

There is a lot to be improved on here, you can polish the required features by crafting a nicer design, or improve the app by adding new features! Choose something that you feel best showcases your passion and skills.

If you need inspiration, here are examples of what you can work on. If you work on these ideas, we recommend choosing only one or two.


Save responses if the user leaves or reloads the page
Let the user choose the AI engine from a select box
Add some presets for the user to quickly send a good prompt
Make the app more specific to a single purpose. See the OpenAI Examples and prompt design docs for inspiration.
